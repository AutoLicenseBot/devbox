devbox
======

My Dev Image, Ubuntu with full Unity, and other tools.

To run simply download and install Vagrant and virtualbox.

http://www.vagrantup.com/
https://www.virtualbox.org/

Then just run the command `vagrant up` when cd'd to the directory containing these files.

After vagrant is done provisioning the machine run `vagrant halt` and then start the VM up manually.

Username and password will be vagrant
